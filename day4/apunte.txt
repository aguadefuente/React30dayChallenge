Inside the body of a regular function, arguments is a special array-like object containing 
the list of arguments with which the function has been invoked
eg: function print() {
        console.log(arguments); // {'0: 'hello', 1: 400, 2: false }
        console.log(arguments[1]); //caca
      }
print("hola", "caca", "pollo");

What is a React Component?
Fundation to build user interface, core concept of React
Are functions which accept an object called props and return something rendarable (other component, strings, null, numbers...)
is a JS function may returns some markup (jsx), that React renders into the browser
and starts in capital letter.
Use a syntax extension called jsx
Use props to comunicate each other
In React every peace of UI is a component
It is define at the top level, no nested inside other component
